/**
 * sharePdf — shared share/save handler for all wizards.
 * buildPdfFilename — sanitised filename builder.
 *
 * In development the debug overlay is shown when share fails so errors are
 * visible on iPad without a connected Mac console.
 * In production the overlay is suppressed — field users should never see
 * raw stack traces.
 *
 * Blob URL cleanup (v2.20.3)
 * ───────────────────────────
 * When the caller passes an existing `blobUrl` (the normal case — every
 * wizard passes `pdfBlobUrl` from usePdfGenerate, which owns and revokes
 * that URL on its own schedule), this function only ever reads it and
 * never touches its lifecycle.
 *
 * When no `blobUrl` is passed, this function previously created its own
 * via `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` in the "share by url" and final
 * `window.open` fallback paths — and never revoked it, leaking one object
 * URL (and the underlying Blob it keeps alive) per share attempt that hit
 * either path. Any self-created URL is now tracked and revoked after a
 * short grace period (long enough for the browser's share sheet or the new
 * tab to finish reading it) once this function is done with it.
 *
 * onSuccess on the fallback path (v2.20.4)
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `onSuccess` (every wizard passes its `clearFormDraft` callback here, so
 * a completed form's autosave/crash-recovery slot is cleared once it's
 * been shared) was previously only invoked on the two `navigator.share()`
 * success paths. Any environment without `navigator.share` (most desktop
 * browsers, some Android browsers) — or where both share attempts fail for
 * a reason other than the user cancelling — falls through to the
 * `window.open` fallback, which never called `onSuccess`. That meant the
 * draft/autosave was silently never cleared on that path: reopening the
 * same form later would still show a stale "unsaved progress found"
 * crash-recovery prompt, even though the tech had already generated and
 * viewed/printed the finished PDF. `onSuccess` is now called after
 * `window.open` too, so the draft is cleared regardless of which path the
 * share/print ends up taking.
