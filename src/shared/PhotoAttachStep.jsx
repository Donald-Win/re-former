/**
 * PhotoAttachStep — shared wizard step for attaching photos to a PDF.
 *
 * Props:
 *   photos   – array of { dataUrl: string, name: string, normalized: boolean }
 *   onChange – setter: (updaterFn) => void  (called with prev => [...prev, newItem])
 *   accent   – optional hex colour string for branding
 *
 * Read-order fix (v2.18.3)
 * ────────────────────────
 * Previously each selected file kicked off its own independent FileReader
 * and appended to `photos` in whichever order its `onload` fired. Since
 * FileReader read time depends on file size, a smaller/later-selected photo
 * could finish decoding before an earlier, larger one — so photos could
 * silently land in the generated PDF in a different order than the user
 * picked them in.
 *
 * Fix: read every selected file as a Promise, wait for all of them via
 * Promise.allSettled (which preserves input order regardless of resolve
 * timing), then append the whole batch to `photos` in one onChange call.
 * This also cuts N re-renders (one per file) down to 1 per batch. Any file
 * that fails to read is skipped (with a console warning) rather than
 * discarding the whole batch.
 *
 * Shift-left compression (v2.20.3)
 * ─────────────────────────────────
 * Photos used to be stored in wizard state — and therefore in every
 * autosave snapshot and every named draft written to IndexedDB — as the
 * FULL-RESOLUTION, uncompressed camera image. Compression only happened
 * later, transiently, inside appendPhotosToPdf.js at the moment a PDF was
 * actually generated, and those compressed bytes were discarded immediately
 * afterward. That meant every autosave tick and every draft save was
 * reading/writing multi-megabyte-per-photo blobs for no lasting benefit.
 *
 * readFileAsPhoto() now resizes and re-compresses each photo to the same
 * dimensions/quality PDF generation uses (1600px longest edge, JPEG 80%)
 * BEFORE it ever enters React state — so the smaller version is what's
 * held in memory, autosaved, and stored in named drafts.
 *
 * If compression fails for any reason (e.g. a tainted canvas from an
 * unusual image source), the original uncompressed image is used instead
 * so the photo is never silently dropped.
 *
 * Skip the second pass entirely when already normalized (v2.20.6)
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each photo is tagged with `normalized: true/false` depending on which of
 * the two paths above it took. `normalized: true` means this photo has
 * already been drawn through a canvas — which is what bakes correct EXIF
 * orientation into the pixels, since pdf-lib's embedJpg ignores EXIF
 * rotation metadata entirely — and resized to the shared MAX px cap.
 * appendPhotosToPdf.js reads this flag and, when true, embeds the bytes
 * directly with no further decode/resize/re-encode pass at all: previously
 * EVERY photo was silently re-processed a second time at generation time
 * regardless of whether that work was still needed, which both wasted CPU
 * and compounded JPEG artifacts on an image already compressed once.
 * `normalized: false` (the rare compression-failure fallback above) tells
 * appendPhotosToPdf.js it must still run its full defensive pipeline on
 * that one photo, since it's still at full resolution and may still carry
 * an EXIF rotation tag. Any photo saved by a version of the app before this
 * flag existed simply has no `normalized` key at all, which is treated the
 * same as `false` — the safe, conservative default — so older saved drafts
 * keep working exactly as before.
